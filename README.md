# MIDNIGHT MARKET

## an NFT marketplace, for all you midnight folks.

This is a long term project I am working on. It is a demo concept for an NFT marketplace, that integrates some really fun technology and concepts.
I will be adding support for real business interactions, with the end goal being a fully functioning, whitelist only NFT market.

### If you really want to test this.

You will need Hardhat installed.

Personal suggestion:!

1. ![ download volta ]("https://volta.sh/")

2. `volta install hardhat`

Next, you would clone this repo, cd into it, and yarn.

### Using Hardhat

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
